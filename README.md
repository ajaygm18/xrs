A modern stock prediction dashboard using LSTM neural networks enhanced with financial news sentiment analysis for improved prediction accuracy.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajaygm18/xrs.git
cd xrs

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run streamlit_stock_predictor.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the dashboard.

## Features

### Core Prediction Engine
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Advanced deep learning model for time series prediction
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, moving averages, and price pattern analysis
- **Multi-currency Support**: Automatic currency detection for international stocks
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: RMSE, directional accuracy, and confidence scores

### üÜï Sentiment Analysis Integration
- **Dual Sentiment Analysis**: Combines TextBlob and VADER sentiment analyzers
- **Financial News Processing**: Analyzes market sentiment from financial news
- **Sentiment-Adjusted Predictions**: Integrates sentiment scores with LSTM predictions
- **Configurable Impact**: Adjustable sentiment weight and maximum adjustment parameters
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses price trend analysis when real news data is unavailable

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Real-time Data**: Live stock data via Yahoo Finance API
- **Interactive Charts**: Price history, volume, sentiment distribution
- **Prediction Comparison**: Visual comparison of different model outputs
- **Responsive Design**: Modern dark theme with gradient styling

## How Sentiment Analysis Improves Predictions

1. **News Sentiment Scoring**: Analyzes financial news headlines and content
2. **Multi-method Analysis**: Combines TextBlob (linguistic) and VADER (social media optimized) sentiment
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Weights sentiment impact by analysis confidence
4. **Bounded Adjustment**: Limits sentiment adjustment to prevent over-correction (default: ¬±3%)
5. **Accuracy Enhancement**: Boosts prediction accuracy when high-confidence sentiment is available

## System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for training)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for dependencies and models
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: Using Conda
```bash
conda create -n stock-predictor python=3.9
conda activate stock-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_stock_predictor.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Basic Workflow
1. **Enter Stock Symbol**: Type a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA)
2. **Configure Settings**: Adjust LSTM and sentiment analysis parameters in the sidebar
3. **Generate Predictions**: Click "Predict" to run the analysis
4. **Review Results**: Examine predictions, charts, and sentiment analysis
5. **Export Data**: Download predictions and charts for further analysis

### Configuration Options

#### LSTM Settings
- **Sequence Length**: Number of historical days to analyze (20-60)
- **Training Epochs**: Model training iterations (20-100)
- **Batch Size**: Training batch size (16-64)

#### Sentiment Analysis Settings
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle sentiment analysis integration
- **Sentiment Weight**: Control sentiment impact strength (0.1-1.0)
- **Max Adjustment**: Maximum percentage adjustment from sentiment (1-5%)

## Example Use Cases

### üìà Bullish Sentiment Example
```
Stock: AAPL
Positive earnings news ‚Üí Sentiment score: +0.6
High confidence ‚Üí Adjustment: +2.1%
LSTM prediction: $150.00 ‚Üí Final: $153.15
Recommendation: BUY (High Confidence)
```

### üìâ Bearish Sentiment Example  
```
Stock: TSLA
Regulatory concerns ‚Üí Sentiment score: -0.4
Medium confidence ‚Üí Adjustment: -1.2%
LSTM prediction: $150.00 ‚Üí Final: $148.20
Recommendation: SELL (Medium Confidence)
```

### ‚û°Ô∏è Neutral Sentiment Example
```
Stock: MSFT
Mixed market signals ‚Üí Sentiment score: 0.1
Low impact ‚Üí Adjustment: +0.1%
LSTM prediction: $150.00 ‚Üí Final: $150.15
Recommendation: HOLD (Low Confidence)
```

## Technical Architecture

### Sentiment Pipeline
1. **News Fetching**: Attempts to fetch financial news (with fallback)
2. **Text Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses news content
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies TextBlob + VADER analysis
4. **Score Aggregation**: Weighted average by confidence
5. **Prediction Adjustment**: Applies bounded sentiment modification

### LSTM Integration
```python
# Sentiment adjustment formula
sentiment_adjustment = (
    sentiment_score * 
    sentiment_strength * 
    confidence * 
    max_adjustment * 
    user_weight
)

adjusted_prediction = base_prediction * (1 + sentiment_adjustment)
```

pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]

# For CPU only (default)
pip install tensorflow
```

#### 2. Streamlit Port Already in Use
```bash
# Use a different port
streamlit run streamlit_stock_predictor.py --server.port 8502
```

#### 3. Memory Errors During Training
- Reduce sequence length in settings (try 20-30 instead of 60)
- Decrease batch size (try 16 instead of 32)
- Close other applications to free memory

#### 4. No News Data Available
- The app includes fallback mechanisms when news APIs are unavailable
- Sentiment analysis will use price trend analysis as backup
- Check internet connection for news feed access

#### 5. Stock Symbol Not Found
- Verify the stock symbol is correct (e.g., AAPL for Apple)
- Use Yahoo Finance format for international stocks (e.g., NESN.SW for Nestl√©)
- Check if the market is active and trading

### Performance Tips
- **For faster predictions**: Reduce training epochs to 20-50
- **For better accuracy**: Increase sequence length to 60 days
- **For memory optimization**: Use smaller batch sizes (16-32)
