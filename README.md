# Stock Price Predictor with Sentiment Analysis

A modern stock prediction dashboard using LSTM neural networks enhanced with financial news sentiment analysis for improved prediction accuracy.

## Features

### Core Prediction Engine
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Advanced deep learning model for time series prediction
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, moving averages, and price pattern analysis
- **Multi-currency Support**: Automatic currency detection for international stocks
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: RMSE, directional accuracy, and confidence scores

### ðŸ†• Sentiment Analysis Integration
- **Dual Sentiment Analysis**: Combines TextBlob and VADER sentiment analyzers
- **Financial News Processing**: Analyzes market sentiment from financial news
- **Sentiment-Adjusted Predictions**: Integrates sentiment scores with LSTM predictions
- **Configurable Impact**: Adjustable sentiment weight and maximum adjustment parameters
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses price trend analysis when real news data is unavailable

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Real-time Data**: Live stock data via Yahoo Finance API
- **Interactive Charts**: Price history, volume, sentiment distribution
- **Prediction Comparison**: Visual comparison of different model outputs
- **Responsive Design**: Modern dark theme with gradient styling

## How Sentiment Analysis Improves Predictions

1. **News Sentiment Scoring**: Analyzes financial news headlines and content
2. **Multi-method Analysis**: Combines TextBlob (linguistic) and VADER (social media optimized) sentiment
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Weights sentiment impact by analysis confidence
4. **Bounded Adjustment**: Limits sentiment adjustment to prevent over-correction (default: Â±3%)
5. **Accuracy Enhancement**: Boosts prediction accuracy when high-confidence sentiment is available

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_stock_predictor.py
```

### Configuration Options

#### LSTM Settings
- **Sequence Length**: Number of historical days to analyze (20-60)
- **Training Epochs**: Model training iterations (20-100)
- **Batch Size**: Training batch size (16-64)

#### Sentiment Analysis Settings
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle sentiment analysis integration
- **Sentiment Weight**: Control sentiment impact strength (0.1-1.0)
- **Max Adjustment**: Maximum percentage adjustment from sentiment (1-5%)

## Example Use Cases

### Bullish Sentiment
- Positive earnings news â†’ Sentiment score: +0.6
- High confidence â†’ Adjustment: +2.1%
- LSTM prediction: $150 â†’ Final: $153.15

### Bearish Sentiment  
- Regulatory concerns â†’ Sentiment score: -0.4
- Medium confidence â†’ Adjustment: -1.2%
- LSTM prediction: $150 â†’ Final: $148.20

### Neutral Sentiment
- Mixed market signals â†’ Sentiment score: 0.1
- Low impact â†’ Adjustment: +0.1%
- LSTM prediction: $150 â†’ Final: $150.15

## Technical Architecture

### Sentiment Pipeline
1. **News Fetching**: Attempts to fetch financial news (with fallback)
2. **Text Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses news content
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies TextBlob + VADER analysis
4. **Score Aggregation**: Weighted average by confidence
5. **Prediction Adjustment**: Applies bounded sentiment modification

### LSTM Integration
```python
# Sentiment adjustment formula
sentiment_adjustment = (
    sentiment_score * 
    sentiment_strength * 
    confidence * 
    max_adjustment * 
    user_weight
)

adjusted_prediction = base_prediction * (1 + sentiment_adjustment)
```
